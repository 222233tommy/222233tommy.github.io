I am currently a second year Ph.D student in the Intelligent Positioning and Navigation Laboratory, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University [ipnl page](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/ipn-lab/us/index.html). My research interests include convex optimization and its application on multi-sensor fusion navigation in urban areas. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by Dr. Li-Ta Hsu and Dr. Weisong Wen. 

For more details, please refer to my CV. [sbs's curriculum vitae](../assets/cv.pdf).
